# Handover — issue #2447

`vibe-handover version=1`

An earlier run working this issue was interrupted before it finished.
The worker wrote this note — not the agent — so any host and any tooling
can pick the work up from this branch. It carries nothing tied to one
host, one conversation or one agent provider.

## This attempt

- 2026-09-21T15:53:35Z — execute timed out after 5409s; 0 uncommitted file(s) preserved; 5 commit(s) added to the branch
- Branch: `issue-2447-pace-the-end-of-cycle-sleep-by-the-graphql-budget`
- Wind-down notice: not delivered — the interruption arrived without warning

## What was done

Commits this run added to the branch, newest first:

- WIP checkpoint: periodic agent progress snapshot (Issue #4170)
- WIP checkpoint: periodic agent progress snapshot (Issue #4170)
- WIP checkpoint: periodic agent progress snapshot (Issue #4170)
- WIP checkpoint: periodic agent progress snapshot (Issue #4170)
- WIP checkpoint: periodic agent progress snapshot (Issue #4170)

The working tree was clean at the interruption — the work above is
already committed on this branch.

## What remains

The run was interrupted after 5409s, so it never reported completion: whatever the issue still asks for beyond the changes above is outstanding.

Diff `issue-2447-pace-the-end-of-cycle-sleep-by-the-graphql-budget` against its base branch to see the 5 commit(s) and 0 preserved file(s) named above, continue from them, and do not revert them unless they are wrong.

The closing deliverables are outstanding too unless the list above names them: completion reads `docs/archive/pr-summaries/pr-summary-2447.md` — with its `## Acceptance Criteria` closure block when the issue states criteria — and a run that finishes without it fails at the gate however complete the code is.

## Known blockers

None were recorded. The run was stopped by the interruption named above,
not by a blocker it reported.
